# Contact form submissions (Contact page + home section).
# Set this in production so form data is sent somewhere you can access.
#
# Option 1 — Formspree (recommended, free tier):
# 1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
# 2. Create a new form, get your endpoint (e.g. https://formspree.io/f/xxxxx)
# 3. Set VITE_CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT to that URL in your host's env (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# 4. Access submissions: Formspree dashboard + email notifications
#
# Option 2 — Any endpoint that accepts POST JSON with: firstName, lastName, email, phone, message

VITE_CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
